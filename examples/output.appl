[_The output in app-lang is buffered. This means we can, for example concatenate multiple strings and numbers by queuing their output:]

[!42]		[_setting current cell to 42]
"First string "	[_putting some string to the same cell]
SwSwSa		[_writing string, then our number to the output buffer, then clearing current string cell]
" second string"[_creating other string]
w		[_putting it to the buffer]
W		[_writing out everything we put in the buffer]
